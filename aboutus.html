        <h1>Co-founders</h1>
          <p class="page-description">Why we created Math Cave: As the pandemic hit the world with no warning, everyone was forced to drop everything and stay at home. Staying at home was tough for everyone but it was especially harder on the little ones. They find it hard to understand what a pandemic is and being told what to do all the time can make them grumpy. After hearing multiple families complain about the stresses both the children and family face, we decided to do something about it. Our purpose was to engage the children in meanigful learning by creating fun math games. Using our background knowledge in computer science, we decided to explore ways we could put our coding experience to use and thus created these fun math games. We know this is not a permanent solution, but we hope kids can find joy in these math games during these difficult times.</p>
